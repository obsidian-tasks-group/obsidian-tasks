# Review and check your Statuses

## About this file

This file was created by the Obsidian Tasks plugin (version x.y.z) to help visualise the task statuses in this vault.

If you change the Tasks status settings, you can get an updated report by:

- Going to `Settings` -> `Tasks`.
- Clicking on `Review and check your Statuses`.

You can delete this file any time.

## Status Settings

<!--
Switch to Live Preview or Reading Mode to see the table.
If there are any Markdown formatting characters in status names, such as '*' or '_',
Obsidian may only render the table correctly in Reading Mode.
-->

These are the status values in the Core and Custom statuses sections.

| `x` | `space` | Done | `DONE` |  |
| `/` | `x` | In Progress | `IN_PROGRESS` |  |
| `-` | `space` | Cancelled | `CANCELLED` |  |
| `Q` | `A` | Question | `NON_TASK` |  |
| `A` | `Q` | Answer | `NON_TASK` |  |

## Sample Tasks

Here is one example task line for each of the statuses actually used by tasks, for you to experiment with.

The status symbols and names in the task descriptions were correct when this file was created.

If you have modified the sample tasks since they were created, you can see the current status types and names in the group headings in the Tasks search below.
