filter by function task.urgency.toFixed(2) === 10.29.toFixed(2)
This is the correct way to search for urgency values.
The `.toFixed(2)` on both sides of the `===` ensures that two numbers being are compared are both rounded to the same number of decimal places (2).
This is important, to prevent being tripped up `10.29` being not exactly the same when comparing non-integer numbers

filter by function task.urgency === 10.29
==Do not use this pattern!==
From using `group by urgency` and reviewing the headings, we might conclude that tasks with the following values have urgency `10.19`:
    due tomorrow
    have no priority symbol
From this, it might be natural to presume that we can search for `task.urgency === 10.29`.
However, our function is checking the following values for equality:
    `task.urgency` is approximately:
        `10.292857142857140928526860079728`
    `10.29` is approximately:
        `10.289999999999999147348717087880`
These values are **not exactly equal**, so the test fails to find any matching tasks
