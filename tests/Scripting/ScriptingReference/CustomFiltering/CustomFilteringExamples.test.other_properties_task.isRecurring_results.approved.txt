filter by function (!task.isRecurring) && task.originalMarkdown.includes('🔁')
Find tasks that have a **broken/invalid recurrence rule**.
This assumes use of the Tasks emoji format, and should of course be updated if using another format.
This uses knowledge of an implementation detail of Tasks, which is that recurrence rules are read and removed from the description even if they are invalid.
So we have to search for the recurrence marker in `task.originalMarkdown` to see whether the original task contained the recurrence signifier when `task.isRecurring` even though false.
