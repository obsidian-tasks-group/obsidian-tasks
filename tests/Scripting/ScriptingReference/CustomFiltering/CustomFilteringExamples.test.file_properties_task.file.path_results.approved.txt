Results of custom filters



filter by function task.file.path.includes('tasks releases/4.1.0 Release.md')
Like 'path includes', except that it is **case-sensitive**: capitalisation matters.
=>
- [ ] In tasks releases/4.1.0 Release.md

filter by function task.file.path === 'tasks releases/4.1.0 Release.md'
An exact, **case-sensitive**, equality search.
Note that the file extension needs to be included too.
With built-in searches, this could only be done using a regular expression, with special characters `^` and `$`, and escaping any characters with special meaning such as `/`.
=>
- [ ] In tasks releases/4.1.0 Release.md

filter by function task.file.path.toLocaleLowerCase() === 'TASKS RELEASES/4.1.0 RELEASE.MD'.toLocaleLowerCase()
An exact, **non**-case-sensitive, equality search.
By lower-casing both values, we do not have to worry about manually lower-casing them in our query.

- [ ] In tasks releases/4.1.0 Release.md
