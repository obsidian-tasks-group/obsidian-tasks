Results of custom filters



filter by function task.due.moment?.isSame('2023-06-11', 'day') || ( !task.due.moment && task.heading?.includes('2023-06-11')) || false
Find takes that:
  **either** due on the date `2023-06-11`,
  **or** do not have a due date, and their preceding heading contains the same date as a string: `2023-06-11`
=>
- [ ] Due on 2023-06-11 ðŸ“… 2023-06-11
- [ ] No due date but I have 2023-06-11 in my preceding heading

filter by function task.due.moment?.isSame(moment(), 'day') || ( !task.due.moment && task.heading?.includes(moment().format('YYYY-MM-DD')) ) || false
Find takes that:
  **either** due on today's date,
  **or** do not have a due date, and their preceding heading contains today's date as a string, formatted as `YYYY-MM-DD`
=>
- [ ] Due on 2023-06-10 ðŸ“… 2023-06-10

filter by function task.heading?.includes('#context/home') || task.tags.find( (tag) => tag === '#context/home' ) && true || false
Find takes that:
  **either** have a tag exactly matching `#context/home` on the task line
  **or** their preceding heading contains the text `#context/home` anywhere
    For demonstration purposes, this is slightly imprecise, in that it would also match nested tasks, such as `#context/home/ground-floor`
=>
- [ ] I have a tag #context/home
- [ ] I do not have a tag context/home but it is in my heading
