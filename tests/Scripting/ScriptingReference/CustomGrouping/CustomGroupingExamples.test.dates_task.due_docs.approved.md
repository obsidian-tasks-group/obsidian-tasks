- ```group by function task.due.category.groupText```
    - Group task due dates in to 4 broad categories: `Overdue`, `Today`, `Future` and `Undated`, displayed in that order.
    - Try this on a line before `group by due` if there are a lot of due date headings, and you would like them to be broken down in to some kind of structure.
    - The values `task.due.category.name` and `task.due.category.sortOrder` are also available.
- ```group by function task.due.fromNow.groupText```
    - Group by the [time from now](https://momentjs.com/docs/#/displaying/fromnow/), for example `8 days ago`, `in 11 hours`.
    - It users an empty string (so no heading) if there is no due date.
    - The values `task.due.fromNow.name` and `task.due.fromNow.sortOrder` are also available.
- ```group by function task.due.format("YYYY-MM-DD dddd")```
    - Like "group by due", except it uses no heading, instead of a heading "No due date", if there is no due date.
- ```group by function task.due.formatAsDate()```
    - Format date as YYYY-MM-DD or empty string (so no heading) if there is no due date.
- ```group by function task.due.formatAsDateAndTime()```
    - Format date as YYYY-MM-DD HH:mm or empty string if no due date.
    - Note:
        - This is shown for demonstration purposes.
        - Currently the Tasks plugin does not support storing of times.
        - Do not add times to your tasks, as it will break the reading of task data.
- ```group by function task.due.format("YYYY[%%]-MM[%%] MMM", "no due date")```
    - Group by month, for example `2023%%-05%% May` ...
        - ... which gets rendered by Obsidian as `2023 May`.
    - Or show a default heading "no due date" if no date.
    - The hidden month number is added, commented-out between two `%%` strings, to control the sort order of headings.
    - To escape characters in format strings, you can wrap the characters in square brackets (here, `[%%]`).
- ```group by function task.due.format("YYYY[%%]-MM[%%] MMM [- Week] WW")```
    - Group by month and week number, for example `2023%%-05%% May - Week 22` ...
        - ... which gets rendered by Obsidian as `2023 May - Week 22`.
    - If the month number is not embedded, in some years the first or last week of the year is displayed in a non-logical order.
