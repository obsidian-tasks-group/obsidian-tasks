group by function task.file.folder.slice(0, -1).split('/').pop() + '/'
Group by the immediate parent folder of the file containing task.
Here's how it works:
    '.slice(0, -1)' removes the trailing slash ('/') from the original folder.
    '.split('/')' divides the remaining path up in to an array of folder names.
    '.pop()' returns the last folder name, that is, the parent of the file containing the task.
    Then the trailing slash is added back, to ensure we do not get an empty string for files in the top level of the vault.
