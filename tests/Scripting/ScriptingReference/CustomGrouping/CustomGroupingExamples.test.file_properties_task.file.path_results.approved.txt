group by function task.file.path.replace(query.file.folder, '')
Group by the task's file path, but remove the query's folder from the group.
For tasks in the query's folder or a sub-folder, this is a nice way of seeing shortened paths.
This is provided to give ideas: it's a bit of a lazy implementation, as it doesn't check that `query.file.folder` is at the start of the line.

a_b_c.md
b.md
b/_c_.md
b/c.md
d/c.md
