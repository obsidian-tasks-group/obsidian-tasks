group by function task.due.format("YYYY[%%]-MM[%%] MMM", "no due date")
Group by month, for example `2023%%-05%% May` ...
    ... which gets rendered by Obsidian as `2023 May`.
Or show a default heading "no due date" if no date.
The hidden month number is added, commented-out between two `%%` strings, to control the sort order of headings.
To escape characters in format strings, you can wrap the characters in square brackets (here, `[%%]`)
=>
2023%%-05%% May
2023%%-06%% Jun

group by function task.due.format("YYYY[%%]-MM[%%] MMM [- Week] WW")
Group by month and week number, for example `2023%%-05%% May - Week 22` ...
    ... which gets rendered by Obsidian as `2023 May - Week 22`.
If the month number is not embedded, in some years the first or last week of the year is displayed in a non-logical order.
