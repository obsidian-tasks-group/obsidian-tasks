Instruction contains unexpanded template text: "<%" - and cannot be interpreted.

Possible causes:
- The query is an a template file, and is not intended to be searched.
- A command such as "Replace templates in the active file" needs to be run.
- The core "Daily notes" plugin is in use, and the template contained
  date calculations that it does not support.
- Some sample template text was accidentally pasted in to a tasks query,
  instead of in to a template file.
