## About this file

This file was created by the Obsidian Tasks plugin (version ${versionString}) to help visualise the task statuses in this vault.

If you change the Tasks status settings, you can get an updated report by:

- Going to \`Settings\` -> \`Tasks\`.
- Clicking on \`Review and check your Statuses\`.

You can delete this file any time.

## Status Settings

<!--
Switch to Live Preview or Reading Mode to see the table.
If there are any Markdown formatting characters in status names, such as '*' or '_',
Obsidian may only render the table correctly in Reading Mode.
-->

These are the status values in the Core and Custom statuses sections.

${settingsTable}
## Loaded Settings

<!-- Switch to Live Preview or Reading Mode to see the diagram. -->

These are the settings actually used by Tasks.

export function getPrintableSymbol(symbol: string) {
    // Do not put backticks around an empty symbol, as the two backticks are rendered
    // by Obsidian as ordinary characters and the meaning is unclear.
    // Better to just display nothing in this situation.
    if (symbol === '') {
        return symbol;
    }
    const result = symbol !== ' ' ? symbol : 'space';
    return '`' + result + '`';
