     * Previously, Tasks would reset+move-right the cursor if there was any text in the line, including something inside the checkbox,
     * moving right by (toggledLine.length - line.length). (Supposedly, but it still moves right, just by less, if the toggledLine is shorter than the old).
     * This missed the need to move right on the blank line to "- " case (issue #460).
     * This also meant the cursor moved nonsensically if it was before any newly inserted text,
     * such as a done date at the end of the line, or after the ">" when "> -" changed to "> - [ ]".

/* Cases (another way):
0) Line got shorter: done date removed from end of task, cursor should reset or be moved to new end if reset position is too long.
1) Line stayed the same length: Checking & unchecking textbox that is not a task - cursor should reset.
2) Line got longer:
    a) List marker could have been added. Find it in new text: if cursor was at or right of where it was added, move the cursor right.
    b) Empty checkbox could have been added. If cursor was after the list marker (in old or new), it should move right.
    c) Done emoji and date could have been added to the end. Cursor should reset if 0, and stay end of line otherwise.
    d) Recurring task could have been added to the beginning and done emoji and date added to the end. Current behavior adds so much to the offset to make this right.

So cursor should be reset if 0, which includes being moved to new end if got shorter. Then might need to move right 2 or 3.
