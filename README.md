Track tasks across your entire vault. Query them and mark them as done wherever you want. Supports due dates, recurring tasks (repetition), done dates, sub-set of checklist items, and filtering.

_You can toggle the task status in any view or query and it will update the source file._

## Screenshots

- _All screenshots assume the [global filter](https://obsidian-tasks-group.github.io/obsidian-tasks/getting-started/global-filter/) `#task` which is not set by default (see also [installation](https://obsidian-tasks-group.github.io/obsidian-tasks/installation/))._
- _The theme is default Obsidian theme._

## Installation

Follow the steps below to install Tasks.

1. Search for "Tasks" in Obsidian's community plugins browser
2. Enable the plugin in your Obsidian settings (find "Tasks" under "Community plugins").
3. Check the settings. It makes sense to set the global filter early on (if you want one).
4. Replace the "Toggle checkbox status" hotkey with "Tasks: Toggle Done".
    - I recommend you remove the original toggle hotkey and set the "Tasks" toggle to `Ctrl + Enter` (or `Cmd + Enter` on a mac).
