# Updating documentation

The documentation resides under the [docs](https://github.com/obsidian-tasks-group/obsidian-tasks/blob/main/docs) directory.
It consists of markdown files, which [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) will transform into web pages that you can view at <https://obsidian-tasks-group.github.io/obsidian-tasks/> .
In the simplest case, you can update the existing markdown file and create a pull request (PR) with your changes.
