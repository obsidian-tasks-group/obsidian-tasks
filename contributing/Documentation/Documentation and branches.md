# Documentation and branches

> [!Note]
> This page is about the original user documentation setup, published using #jekyll on #github-pages.

For documentation changes to show up at <https://obsidian-tasks-group.github.io/obsidian-tasks/> , they must be in the `gh-pages` branch.
If you want to see your changes available immediately and not only after the next release, you should make your changes on the `gh-pages` branch.
When you create a PR, it should merge into the `gh-pages` branch as well.
If you document an unreleased feature, you should update the documentation on `main` instead. Ideally together with the related code changes.
If this is confusing, don't worry.
We will help you make this right once you opened the PR.
