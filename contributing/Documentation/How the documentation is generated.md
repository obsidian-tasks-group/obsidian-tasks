# How the documentation is generated

> [!Note]
> This page is about the original user documentation setup, published using #jekyll on #github-pages.

We use [GitHub pages](https://pages.github.com/) for our documentation.
You can read more about it at their [official documentation](https://docs.github.com/en/pages).

To generate the documentation site on your machine,
see [[Test documentation locally with Jekyll]].
