# Publishing with Obsidian Publish

The `docs/` and `contributing/` vaults are published with Obsidian Publish.

## Permission to publish

The following people's Obsidian accounts have permission to push Updates to the Tasks sites:

- Clare Macrae (`@claremacrae`)
- Martin Schenck (`@schemar`)

## Quick overview

See [Publish and unpublish notes](https://help.obsidian.md/Obsidian+Publish/Publish+and+unpublish+notes) for guidance.

The big missing bit of information in that page is that you need to look for this icon in the ribbon in order to publish:
