# Updating code

<span class="related-pages">#pull-requests</span>

Ideally, an [issue](https://github.com/obsidian-tasks-group/obsidian-tasks/issues) or
[Discussion](https://github.com/obsidian-tasks-group/obsidian-tasks/discussions) already exists
and we discussed your implementation in that issue before you open the pull request (PR).
This is _not_ mandatory, but it helps improve the process and reduce unnecessary back-and-forth.

Once you want to propose your changes, create a PR and we'll have a look when we have time.
Discussion will take place inside the PR.

If you can, please add/update [[About Testing|tests]] and [[About Documentation|documentation]] where appropriate.
