# Updating code

<span class="related-pages">#pull-requests</span>

> [!NOTE]
> **February 2026**: Because of the growth of AI-generated PRs that are taking a *lot* of effort to handle, we have had to refine these instructions.

## Initial issue or discussion is now required

Requirements:

1. An [issue](https://github.com/obsidian-tasks-group/obsidian-tasks/issues) or [Discussion](https://github.com/obsidian-tasks-group/obsidian-tasks/discussions) already exists,
2. Ideally, we discussed your implementation in that issue before you open the pull request (PR).

## Creating the PR

Once you want to propose your changes, create a PR and we'll have a look when we have time.
Discussion will take place inside the PR.

If you can, please add/update [[About Testing|tests]] and [[About Documentation|documentation]] where appropriate.
