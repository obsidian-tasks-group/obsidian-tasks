# How do I see circular dependencies

This page assumes that you have already set up your [[Setting up build environment#local build environment]]

## What are circular dependencies?

The article [Tired of circular dependency in Typescript/Node.js?](https://dev.to/tahsinature/tired-of-circular-dependency-in-typescriptnodejs-4i0a) has a good explanation, building on the following quote from [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circular_dependency):

> In software engineering, a circular dependency is a relation between two or more modules which either directly or indirectly depend on each other to function properly. Such modules are also known as mutually recursive.

## How to see circular dependencies in Tasks?

### Via GitHub Actions builds

- Browse to the [Verify Commit logs](https://github.com/obsidian-tasks-group/obsidian-tasks/actions/workflows/verify.yml)
  - Choose the branch of interest (at top-right)
  - Click on the most recent run of code on that branch
- Click on the `circular-dependencies` link in the Artifacts list at the bottom of the page to down the results
  - Expand the .zip file
- View the two files:
  - `circular-deps.txt`
  - `circular-deps.png`

### On your local machine

- Install [Graphviz](https://graphviz.org), making sure that the [gvpr](https://graphviz.org/docs/cli/gvpr/) command is available
- Run one of the following commands:

```bash
yarn run circular-deps-text
yarn run circular-deps-image
```

## Example output files

%%Note on a slight cheat: an SVG is shown here, as it gives better scaling when published.
But the appearance is the same as the generated PNG %%
