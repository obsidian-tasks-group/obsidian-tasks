# Maintaining the tests

This project really cares about automated testing of its source code.

It's not perfect, but it is valuable and we try to continually improve the tests.

## Jest test framework

The tests use the [ts-jest](https://www.npmjs.com/package/ts-jest) wrapper around the
[jest](https://jestjs.io) test framework.

The [Expect](https://jestjs.io/docs/expect) page is a good reference for the many jest testing features.
