# Test Coverage

`yarn run jest --coverage` will generate a coverage report in the `coverage` directory, which is ignored by this project's [.gitignore](https://github.com/obsidian-tasks-group/obsidian-tasks/blob/main/.gitignore).
Your IDE may also be able to show you the test coverage of a source file.
Adding tests where possible - see [[#Location of code]] for constraints to code not currently covered by the automated tests is a great way to contribute!
