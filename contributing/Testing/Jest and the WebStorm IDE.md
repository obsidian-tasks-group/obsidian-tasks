# Jest and the WebStorm IDE

The WebStorm IDE has a [helpful page](https://www.jetbrains.com/help/webstorm/running-unit-tests-on-jest.html)
on how it makes testing with jest easy.

Note in particular the
[Snapshot testing section](https://www.jetbrains.com/help/webstorm/running-unit-tests-on-jest.html#ws_jest_snapshot_testing)
for how to view the diffs in the event of snapshot test failures, and also how to update the saved snapshot
of one or all snapshot failures.
