# FAQs

FAQs generally go in the specific folder for their topic, like 'Debugging'.

The remaining issues here are all related to details of plugin code, because I haven't yet managed to come up with a 1 or 2 word folder-name to summarise their purpose.

- [[How do I add a new field to the Task class]]
- [[How do I add a new task filter]]
- [[How do I add one-click support for new themes or snippets for custom statuses]]
- [[How does Tasks handle status changes]]
