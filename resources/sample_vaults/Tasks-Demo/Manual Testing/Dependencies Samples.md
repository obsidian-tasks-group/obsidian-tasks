## Real-world searches

### Blocking and Not Blocked - Do very soon

```tasks
is blocking
is not blocked
# by definition these are all 'not done'

path includes {{query.file.path}}
#explain
```

### Not Blocking and Not Blocked - Do any time

```tasks
is not blocking
is not blocked

# DONE, CANCELLED and NON_TASK are never blocking nor blocked,
# so we need to exclude those:
not done

path includes {{query.file.path}}
#explain
```

### Blocked - Cannot yet do

```tasks
is blocked
# by definition these are all 'not done'

path includes {{query.file.path}}
#explain
```

## Demonstration searches - showing the Blocking instructions

### `is blocking` - Blocking Tasks - tasks which prevent others from being done

```tasks
is blocking

path includes {{query.file.path}}
#explain
```

### `is not blocking` - Non-blocking Tasks - Not Done

```tasks
is not blocking
not done

path includes {{query.file.path}}
#explain
```

### `is not blocking` - Non-blocking Tasks - Any Status

```tasks
is not blocking

path includes {{query.file.path}}
#explain
```

---

## Demonstration searches - showing the Blocked instructions

### `is blocked` - Blocked Tasks - tasks which cannot be done yet

```tasks
is blocked

path includes {{query.file.path}}
#explain
```

### `is not blocked` - Non-blocked Tasks - Not Done

```tasks
is not blocked
not done

path includes {{query.file.path}}
#explain
```

### `is not blocked` - Non-blocked Tasks - Any Status

```tasks
is not blocked

path includes {{query.file.path}}
#explain
```

---

## Show/Hide Instructions

### `hide id`

```tasks
hide id
path includes {{query.file.path}}
#explain
```

### `hide depends on`

```tasks
hide depends on
path includes {{query.file.path}}
#explain
```
