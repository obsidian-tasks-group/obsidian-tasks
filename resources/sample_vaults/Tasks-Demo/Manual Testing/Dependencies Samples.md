## Real-world searches

### Blocking and Not Blocked - Do very soon

```tasks
is blocking
is not blocked
# by definition these are all 'not done'

path includes {{query.file.path}}
#explain
```

### Not Blocking and Not Blocked - Do any time

```tasks
is not blocking
is not blocked

# DONE, CANCELLED and NON_TASK are never blocking nor blocked,
# so we need to exclude those:
not done

path includes {{query.file.path}}
#explain
```

### Blocked - Cannot yet do

```tasks
is blocked
# by definition these are all 'not done'

path includes {{query.file.path}}
#explain
```
