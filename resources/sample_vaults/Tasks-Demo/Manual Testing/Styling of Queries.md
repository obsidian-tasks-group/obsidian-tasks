To test styling of queries, follow these steps, viewing this file either in **Reading** Mode or **Live Preview** Mode:

- [ ] **1. Open the Obsidian settings of the Demo vault and under Appearance | CSS Snippets, turn on `tasks-plugin-smoke-test-query-styling`.**

- [ ] **2.** **Test 'group by' classes** - the following query result should have **red headings** named 'Priority 1: High' and 'Priority 4: Low'.

```tasks
path includes Styling of Queries
description includes priority
group by priority
```

- [ ] **3. Test 'group by' classes #2** - the following should have a **black** heading named 'No due date':

```tasks
path includes Styling of Queries
description includes priority
group by due
```

- [ ] **4. Test short mode classes** - the following should have an aqua background:

```tasks
path includes Styling of Queries
description includes priority
short mode
```

- [ ] **5. Test 'hidden' query classes** - the following lines should be colored **red**:

```tasks
path includes Styling of Queries
description includes priority
hide priority
hide backlinks
hide urgency
hide edit button
```

- [ ] **6. Test the colouring by tag presence** - this should:
  - **show** the task's tag `#todo/strategic`:
  - **show** the description in red
  - **show** the tag in the group heading

```tasks
path includes Styling of Queries
description includes tag
group by tags
hide backlink
```

- [ ] **7. Test the colouring by tag presence when tags hidden** - this should:
  - **hide** the task's tag `#todo/strategic`
  - **still show** the description in red
  - **still show** the tag in the group heading

```tasks
path includes Styling of Queries
description includes tag
group by tags
hide tags
hide backlink
```

- [ ] **8. Open the Obsidian settings** of the Demo vault and under Appearance | CSS Snippets, turn **off** `tasks-plugin-smoke-test-query-styling`.
