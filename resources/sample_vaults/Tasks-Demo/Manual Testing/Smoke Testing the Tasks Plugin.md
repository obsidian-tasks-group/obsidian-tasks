# Smoke Testing the Tasks Plugin

## Introduction

- **Intended audience of this note**
  - Developers working on the Tasks plugin, reviewing a Pull Request (especially ones that change dependencies), or making a release, and who wish to do some basic tests of the plugin to make sure there are no glaring show-stopper errors.
- **What is a Smoke Test?**
  - As [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smoke_testing_(software)) says: smoke testing ... is preliminary testing to reveal simple failures severe enough to, for example, reject a prospective software release.
- **Why not test everything?**
  - The Tasks plugin is run by volunteers in our finite spare time. We take care during development to write automated tests for the algorithms in our code, but there are some kinds of changes, such as in tools the project depends on, that we do not have automated tests for.
- **Why not test on every platform?**
  - It's not feasible nor a good use of limited volunteer time on a free tool.

## How the tests work

- Make sure you have the [obsidian-tasks repo](https://github.com/obsidian-tasks-group/obsidian-tasks)cloned and up-to-date on your machine.
- Open the Tasks-Demo vault on a machine of your choice:
  - Open Obsidian
  - Click 'Open another vault' button
  - Click 'Open folder as vault' button
  - Navigate to `obsidian-tasks/resources/sample_vaults/Tasks-Demo`
  - Click 'Open'
- Install the candidate build for the pull request or release inside the `Tasks-Demo` vault
  - See the [FAQs in the CONTRIBUTING page](https://github.com/obsidian-tasks-group/obsidian-tasks/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md#faqs).
- This note is a self-contained set of steps to check. You should check off tasks beginning `- [ ] check:` as you complete each section.

> [!Important]
> Several task blocks in this file depend of the the file name being unchanged. Please don't rename the file before running the tests.

## The Smoke Tests

### Completion of tasks

- [ ] #task Mark this task complete in **Source view** using **Tasks: Toggle task done** command
- [ ] #task Mark this task complete by clicking on it in **Reading view**
- [ ] #task Mark this task complete by clicking on it in **Live Preview**
- [ ] #task **check**: Checked all above methods for **completing tasks** - and they worked

### Un-completion of tasks

- [x] #task Mark this task not complete in **Source view** using **Tasks: Toggle task done** command ✅ 2022-07-05
- [x] #task Mark this task not complete by clicking on it in **Reading view** ✅ 2022-07-05
- [x] #task Mark this task not complete by clicking on it in **Live Preview** ✅ 2022-07-05
- [ ] #task **check**: Checked all above methods for **un-completing tasks** - and they worked

### Recurring Tasks

Confirm that when a recurring task is completed, a new task is created, all the date fields are incremented, and the indentation is unchanged.

> - [ ] #task **check**: Checked all above steps for **recurring tasks** worked

### Rendering of Task Blocks

Steps to do:

- [ ] #task View this file in **Reading view** and confirm that the tasks in this section are listed
- [ ] #task View this file in **Live Preview** and confirm that the tasks in this section are listed
- [ ] #task **check**: Checked all above steps for **viewing task blocks** worked

Tasks block to check - should list all the tasks in this section, regardless of state

```tasks
path includes Smoke Testing the Tasks Plugin
heading includes Rendering of Task Blocks
```
