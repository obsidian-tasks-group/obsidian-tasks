# Tasks Plugin Skill

This skill enables Claude Code to create valid task syntax and queries for the Obsidian Tasks plugin.

## Overview

The Tasks plugin extends Obsidian's checkbox functionality with:
- Due dates, scheduled dates, start dates
- Recurrence rules
- Priorities
- Query blocks for dynamic task lists
- Custom statuses

## Task Syntax

### Basic Task Format

```markdown
- [ ] Task description
- [x] Completed task
```

### Task Components

A task can include multiple components in any order:

```markdown
- [ ] Task description 📅 2024-02-15 ⏫ 🔁 every week
```

| Emoji | Meaning | Format |
|-------|---------|--------|
| 📅 | Due date | `📅 YYYY-MM-DD` |
| ⏳ | Scheduled date | `⏳ YYYY-MM-DD` |
| 🛫 | Start date | `🛫 YYYY-MM-DD` |
| ➕ | Created date | `➕ YYYY-MM-DD` |
| ✅ | Done date | `✅ YYYY-MM-DD` |
| ❌ | Cancelled date | `❌ YYYY-MM-DD` |
| 🔁 | Recurrence | `🔁 every ...` |
| 🔺 | Highest priority | `🔺` |
| ⏫ | High priority | `⏫` |
| 🔼 | Medium priority | `🔼` |
| 🔽 | Low priority | `🔽` |
| ⏬ | Lowest priority | `⏬` |
| 🆔 | ID | `🆔 abc123` |
| ⛔ | Depends on | `⛔ abc123` |
| 🏁 | On completion | `🏁 keep` or `🏁 delete` |

### Alternative Text Formats

Instead of emojis, you can use text:

| Emoji | Text Alternative |
|-------|------------------|
| 📅 | `[due:: YYYY-MM-DD]` |
| ⏳ | `[scheduled:: YYYY-MM-DD]` |
| 🛫 | `[start:: YYYY-MM-DD]` |
| ➕ | `[created:: YYYY-MM-DD]` |
| ✅ | `[completion:: YYYY-MM-DD]` |
| ❌ | `[cancelled:: YYYY-MM-DD]` |
| 🔺 | `[priority:: highest]` |
| ⏫ | `[priority:: high]` |
| 🔼 | `[priority:: medium]` |
| 🔽 | `[priority:: low]` |
| ⏬ | `[priority:: lowest]` |

## Dates

### Date Formats

```markdown
📅 2024-02-15
⏳ 2024-02-10
🛫 2024-02-01
➕ 2024-02-01
```

Dates must be in `YYYY-MM-DD` format.

### Date Types

| Date | Purpose |
|------|--------|
| **Due** (📅) | When task must be completed |
| **Scheduled** (⏳) | When you plan to work on it |
| **Start** (🛫) | When task becomes available |
| **Created** (➕) | When task was created |
| **Done** (✅) | When task was completed |
| **Cancelled** (❌) | When task was cancelled |

### Examples

```markdown
- [ ] Submit report 📅 2024-02-15
- [ ] Start project 🛫 2024-02-01 📅 2024-02-28
- [ ] Review document ⏳ 2024-02-10 📅 2024-02-12
- [ ] Call client 📅 2024-02-15 ➕ 2024-02-01
```

## Priorities

### Priority Levels

| Priority | Emoji |
|----------|-------|
| Highest | 🔺 |
| High | ⏫ |
| Medium | 🔼 |
| None | (none) |
| Low | 🔽 |
| Lowest | ⏬ |

### Examples

```markdown
- [ ] Critical bug fix 🔺
- [ ] High priority task ⏫
- [ ] Medium priority 🔼
- [ ] Low priority 🔽
- [ ] Lowest priority ⏬
```

## Recurrence

### Recurrence Syntax

```markdown
🔁 every <interval>
🔁 every <n> <period>
🔁 every <period> when done
🔁 every <period> on <day>
```

### Recurrence Periods

| Period | Aliases |
|--------|--------|
| `day` | `daily` |
| `week` | `weekly` |
| `month` | `monthly` |
| `year` | `yearly` |

### Recurrence Examples

```markdown
- [ ] Daily standup 🔁 every day 📅 2024-02-15
- [ ] Weekly review 🔁 every week 📅 2024-02-16
- [ ] Monthly report 🔁 every month 📅 2024-02-28
- [ ] Annual review 🔁 every year 📅 2024-12-31

- [ ] Every 3 days 🔁 every 3 days 📅 2024-02-15
- [ ] Biweekly 🔁 every 2 weeks 📅 2024-02-15
- [ ] Quarterly 🔁 every 3 months 📅 2024-03-31

- [ ] Every Monday 🔁 every week on Monday 📅 2024-02-19
- [ ] Every Mon/Wed/Fri 🔁 every week on Monday, Wednesday, Friday 📅 2024-02-16
- [ ] First of month 🔁 every month on the 1st 📅 2024-03-01
- [ ] Last Friday 🔁 every month on the last Friday 📅 2024-02-23
```

### When Done vs Fixed Schedule

```markdown
- [ ] Water plants 🔁 every week 📅 2024-02-15
```
When completed, next due = previous due + 1 week

```markdown
- [ ] Water plants 🔁 every week when done 📅 2024-02-15
```
When completed, next due = completion date + 1 week

### Ordinal Days

```markdown
🔁 every month on the 1st
🔁 every month on the 15th
🔁 every month on the last
🔁 every month on the last day
🔁 every month on the first Monday
🔁 every month on the second Tuesday
🔁 every month on the third Wednesday
🔁 every month on the fourth Thursday
🔁 every month on the last Friday
```

## Task Dependencies

### ID and Dependencies

```markdown
- [ ] First task 🆔 task1
- [ ] Second task ⛔ task1
- [ ] Third task ⛔ task1,task2
```

Tasks with dependencies are blocked until dependencies are completed.

## On Completion

Control what happens when a task is completed:

```markdown
- [ ] Keep this task when done 🏁 keep
- [ ] Delete this task when done 🏁 delete
- [ ] Delete completed recurring instance 🔁 every day 🏁 delete
```

Default behavior keeps the completed task. Use `🏁 delete` to remove it.

## Custom Statuses

### Default Statuses

| Status | Character | Type |
|--------|-----------|------|
| Todo | `[ ]` | `TODO` |
| Done | `[x]` | `DONE` |

### Custom Statuses (Require Configuration)

Custom statuses must be configured in Tasks settings before use. Common examples:

| Status | Character | Type | Meaning |
|--------|-----------|------|--------|
| In Progress | `[/]` | `IN_PROGRESS` | Working on it |
| Cancelled | `[-]` | `CANCELLED` | Won't do |
| Forwarded | `[>]` | `TODO` | Moved to later |
| Scheduled | `[<]` | `TODO` | Scheduled |
| Question | `[?]` | `TODO` | Need info |

### Examples

```markdown
- [ ] Not started (default)
- [x] Completed (default)
- [/] In progress (requires configuration)
- [-] Cancelled (requires configuration)
```

## Task Queries

## Urgency

Tasks are automatically scored for urgency based on:
- Priority
- Due date proximity
- Overdue status
- Scheduled date
- Start date

Urgency scoring can be customized in Tasks settings.

View with: `show urgency`

Sort with: `sort by urgency reverse`

## Custom Filters and Groups

For complex logic, use JavaScript functions:

```
filter by function task.due.moment?.isSameOrBefore(moment(), 'day') || false
group by function task.due.moment?.format("YYYY-MM") ?? "No date"
```
