# Global Filter

> [!tip]
> Since Tasks X.Y.Z, a new [[Global Query]] facility has been added, which offers a lot more flexibility than the Global Filter.

## Optional Global Filter

You can set a global filter in the settings so that Tasks only matches specific checklist items.
For example, you could set it to `#task` to only track checklist items as task if they include the string `#task`.
It doesn't have to be a tag. It can be any string.
Leave it empty to regard all checklist items as tasks.

Example with global filter `#task`:

```markdown
- [ ] #task take out the trash
```

If you don't have a global filter set, all regular checklist items will be considered a task:

```markdown
- [ ] take out the trash
```

> [!warning]
> If you use a tag such as `#task` as the global filter, you cannot add sub-tags to that tag.

## Settings for the Global Filter

The following settings in the Tasks Options pane control the vault's global filter.

Note you must restart Tasks after changing any settings here.
