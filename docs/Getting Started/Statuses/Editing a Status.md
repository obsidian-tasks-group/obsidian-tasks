# Editing a Status

<span class="related-pages">#feature/statuses</span>

## Overview

This page describes features of the modal used for editing a Status.

You open the modal by clicking Pencil icon to the right of any of your statuses, in the Tasks Settings:

![Sample new status](../../images/settings-custom-statuses-new-empty-status.png)<br>
*Above: Sample empty status row in Settings, with Pencil icon at the right.*

<!--
![Sample populated status](../../images/settings-custom-statuses-added.png)<br>
-->

## Editing the Status

When you edit a new task status, the modal looks like this:

![The modal for editing statuses](../../images/settings-custom-statuses-dialog-1.png)

Notice the red colouring, to indicate values which are not yet valid.

If you aren't sure why something is invalid, click on the Checkmark button and an explanatory notice will pop up for a few seconds. Or see [[#Validation]] below.

## Saving the Status

Once you have added or edited the desired information, and none of the fields are red, you can click on the Checkmark to save the Status.

![Enter the values for our new status](../../images/settings-custom-statuses-dialog-2.png)

## Validation

Red warnings will be shown if any of the following checks are not satisfied:

- The two Symbol values must be a single character.
- The Name cannot be empty.

## Limitations and Issues

- Currently hitting Return to save changes and close the modal only works if you Tab through all the values until the Checkmark button has focus.
