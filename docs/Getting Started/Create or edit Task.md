# 'Create or edit Task' Modal

## Introduction

![Create or Edit Modal](../images/modal.png)
<br>The `Tasks: Create or edit` command helps you when adding or editing a task.

## Opening the 'Create or edit Task' Modal

Use the command 'Tasks: Create or edit task' to launch the modal.

- If the cursor was on an existing task, the modal will modify that task's properties.
- If the cursor was on a blank line, the modal will create a brand new task on that line.

## Keyboard shortcuts

> [!released]
Introduced in Tasks 1.17.0.

All the fields of the form have "access keys", that is, keyboard shortcuts. The access keys are displayed as the underlined letters in the labels.

- On Windows, press the `Alt`-key and the underlined letter at the same time.
- On Mac, press `Ctrl`-key and the `Option`-key and the underlined letter at the same time.

### Turning off keyboard shortcuts

> [!released]
Introduced in Tasks 1.17.0.

If the access keys (keyboard shortcuts) for any field conflicts with system keyboard shortcuts or interferes with assistive technology functionality that is important for you, you may want to turn them off in the Tasks plugin's settings:

This setting takes immediate effect, and does not require restarting of Obsidian.

## Entering values

### Description

This is the text describing your task.

If you have a [[Global Filter|global filter]] enabled, the dialog takes care of adding it automatically.

The description box can be enlarged by dragging its corner. Multi-line text can be pasted in, or dragged-and-dropped in, and Tasks will remove the end-of-line characters automatically.

> [!released]
Description field became resizable in Tasks 2.0.0.

### Priority

See [[Priority|priority]].

### Recurrence

Here you can make the task recur, so that when it is marked as done, a new task is created, with newer dates.

See [[Recurring Tasks|recurring tasks (repetition)]].

### Dates

Here you can optionally give the task
[[Dates#Due date|due]],
[[Dates#Scheduled date|scheduled]] and
[[Dates#Start date|start]] dates.

There is a lot of flexibility here. For example:

- You can type in exact dates, such as `2022-11-28`.
- You can also enter parts of dates, such as `6 oct`.
- You can enter relative dates, such as `today` or `tomorrow` or `Saturday`.

Note that relative dates will be always interpreted as being in the future, because that is usually what you want. You can change this behavior by unchecking "Only future dates" if you want to enter an overdue task or experiment with the way how relative dates in the past would be interpreted in queries.

> [!released]
`Only future dates` was introduced in Tasks 1.15.0.

### Date abbreviations

> [!released]
Introduced in Tasks 1.8.0.

The modal also has a few abbreviations of its own, to speed up entering of common values in the date fields.

Type in the abbreviation and then a space character, and the whole word will be entered for you.

Supported abbreviations:

| Abbreviation | Expanded Text |
| ------------ | ------------- |
| `td`         | `today`       |
| `tm`         | `tomorrow`    |
| `yd`         | `yesterday`   |
| `tw`         | `this week`   |
| `nw`         | `next week`   |
| `weekend`    | `sat`         |
| `we`         | `sat`         |

### Status

> [!released]
Introduced in Tasks 1.23.0.

Use the Status dropdown to change the Status Symbol for the task.

![Task edit modal shows new statuses immediately](../images/modal-showing-new-statuses.png)

For more information, including adding your own customised statuses, see [[Statuses]].

> [!warning]
> Editing the Status in the modal does not yet add, remove or update the Done date.
>
> Also, completing a recurring task via the Status in the modal does not yet add the new recurrence.
>
> For now, you should still complete tasks via command or by clicking on task checkboxes.

## Display values

These values cannot currently be edited in this modal.

### Completed

A read-only checkbox, showing whether the task is completed.

### Created on

> [!released]
Created date was introduced in Tasks 2.0.0.

A read-only display of the task's [[Dates#Created date|created date]], if any.

If you have enabled ‘Set created date on every added task’ in Tasks settings (and restarted Obsidian), when you create a new Task via this modal, today's date will be added automatically.

### Done on

A read-only display of the task's [[Dates#Done date|done date]], if any.

## Finishing off

To close the modal and save your edits, do one of:

- click `Apply`,
- press `Return` or `Enter`.

To close the modal and cancel your edits, do one of:

- click `Cancel`,
- click or tap outside the modal,
- click the close button at the corner of the modal (if one exists on your operating system),
- hit the `Esc` key.

## Known limitations

### Need to scroll on phone screens

On phone screens the 'Create or edit Task' Modal may be too tall to fit on the screen.
It does support scrolling, and on Android, the scrollbar is visible.

Unfortunately iPhones don't display the scrollbar until you actually start scrolling.
Tap on the screen and drag down, and you will see a scrollbar appear temporarily.
More importantly, the scrolling does then work fine.

We are tracking the iPhone scrollbar issue in [issue #1238](https://github.com/obsidian-tasks-group/obsidian-tasks/issues/1238).

## Use this modal in scripts and other plugins

The [[Tasks Api|Tasks API Interface]] allows this modal to be used outside of the Tasks plugin, for example in QuickAdd scripts, and by other plugins.
