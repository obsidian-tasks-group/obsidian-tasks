# Settings

## Restart after changing settings

Regrettably, many of the settings for customising Tasks require one of the following to be done, for the new options to take effect:

- Obsidian to be restarted,
- or the vault to be closed and re-opened.

The Tasks Settings pane warns of this:

![Changing any settings requires a restart of obsidian](../images/settings-restart-after-change.png)

## Available settings

As the number of options in Tasks has grown, we have documented each setting in the page for the relevant topic.

For convenience, here is a list of all those documentation pages (in the order the options appear in the Tasks Settings pane):

- [[About Task Formats#Selecting the task format]]
- [[Global Filter]]
- [[Global Query]]
- [[Status Settings]]
- [[Dates#Date-tracking settings]]
- [[Recurring Tasks#Order of the new task]]
- [[Auto-Suggest]]
- [[Create or edit Task#Turning off keyboard shortcuts]]
