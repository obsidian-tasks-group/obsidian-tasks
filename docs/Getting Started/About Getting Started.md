<span class="related-pages">#index-pages</span>

## Basics

- [[Installation]]
- [[Getting Started]]
  - Descriptive overview of setting up your tasks.
  - Also has a long list of known limitations.
- [[Global Filter]]
  - **Optionally** set a global filter so Tasks only matches specific checklist items.
  - See also [[Global Query]], which is much more powerful, once you know how searching works.
- [[Settings]]
  - A convenient list of all the Tasks plugin options.

## Adding data to your tasks

- [[Dates]]
  - Record when you need to work on your tasks.
  - Track the history of your tasks.
- [[Priority]]
  - Indicate the importance of your tasks.
- [[Recurring Tasks]]
  - Use recurring tasks to easily track actions you must do regularly.
- [[On Completion]]
  - Specify an automatic action to perform on a task when it is completed.
- [[Statuses]]
  - Also known as Custom Checkboxes.
  - In vanilla Obsidian tasks are either 'TODO' or 'DONE'.
  - Statuses allow you to track `IN_PROGRESS`, `CANCELLED` and `NON_TASK` actions too.
- [[Use Filename as Default Date]]
  - Automatically set a scheduled date for tasks based on the name of their files.
- [[Tags]]
  - Why and how to use tags to manage your tasks.

## More specialised facilities

- [[Task Dependencies]]
  - Define the order in which you want to work on a set of tasks.
  - Then adjust your searches, perhaps to see tasks that are [[Filters#Blocking Tasks|blocking others]], or hide ones that are [[Filters#Blocked Tasks|blocked]] and cannot yet be done.
- [[Obsidian Properties]]
  - Learn how to use data in Obsidian [Properties](https://help.obsidian.md/Editing+and+formatting/Properties) in your queries, for example to only search tasks in Kanban plugin files.
