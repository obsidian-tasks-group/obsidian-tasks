# Installation

Follow the steps below to install Tasks.

1. Search for "Tasks" in Obsidian's community plugins browser
2. Enable the plugin in your Obsidian settings (find "Tasks" under "Community plugins").
3. Check the settings. It makes sense to set the global filter early on (if you want one).
4. Replace the "Toggle checklist status" hotkey with "Tasks: Toggle Done".
    - I recommend you remove the original toggle hotkey and set the "Tasks" toggle to `Ctrl + Enter` (or `Cmd + Enter` on a mac).
