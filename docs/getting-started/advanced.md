## Additional Dates
In addition to the 📅 [due dates]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link getting-started/due-dates.md %}), Tasks also supports a 🛫 start date and a ⏳ scheduled time.
Use the respective signifiers (🛫/⏳) or use the `Tasks: create or edit` command to specify the dates in the pop-up modal.

These dates work the same way as the due date and are optional, as is the due date.

See [Recurrence]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link getting-started/recurring-tasks.md %}#dates) on how dates are handled for recurring tasks.
