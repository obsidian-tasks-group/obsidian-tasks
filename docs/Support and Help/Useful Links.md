  - [Discussions](https://github.com/obsidian-tasks-group/obsidian-tasks/discussions)
- [Roadmap](https://github.com/orgs/obsidian-tasks-group/projects/4)
  - This shows items that I (Clare Macrae) have prioritised and would like to do eventually, given enough free time.
  - The Roadmap makes visible the Issues that are labelled `priority: high`, and puts them in the rough order that they might be done on.
  - It is just a rough guideline, mainly to convey the size of the backlog: The volume of requests on the Tasks project is so large that it is impossible to say with any confident _if_ or _when_ any item might be done.
