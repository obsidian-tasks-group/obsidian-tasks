# Request a Feature

See also [[Report a Bug]].

## Before requesting a feature

> [!important]
> Don't waste your time crafting a careful request for something we are either already tracking, or have already declined.

- Is it already possible?
  - Check the relevant section of the Tasks documentation.
- Is it already requested?
  - Review the existing feature requests  [here](https://github.com/obsidian-tasks-group/obsidian-tasks/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3A%22type%3A+enhancement%22), [here](https://github.com/obsidian-tasks-group/obsidian-tasks/issues?q=is%3Aissue+label%3A%22type%3A+enhancement%22+is%3Aclosed) and [here](https://github.com/obsidian-tasks-group/obsidian-tasks/discussions/categories/ideas-any-new-feature-requests-go-in-issues-please?discussions_q=category%3A%22Ideas%3A+Any+New+Feature+Requests+go+in+Issues+please%22+sort%3Atop)
  - If it is, up-vote it with a üëç (in Issues) or the up-arrow (in Discussions).
- Can it be achieved using another plugin?
- Is it specific only to your personal workflow?
  - Some requests demand volunteer time for something very specific to one person's way of working.
- Is it outside the scope of this plugin?
  - We won't be adding [time-tracking, productivity tracking, pomodoros, notifications](https://github.com/obsidian-tasks-group/obsidian-tasks/issues/2721) and similar...
- Is it really multiple features?
  - One feature per request, please.
