# Known Limitations

<!--

MAINTENANCE NOTES

Each time a new 'Limitations'-type section is added to another page, add:

- A level-2 heading here
- And an embedded link - `![[....]]` to the new file and heading

How we make sure this page has an Outline when published:

- Embedded headings are not shown in Outline of this file - either in Reading view and when published
- Hence a level-2 heading is added in this file, so its structure its visible
- To prevent duplicate headings being rendered, any level-2 headings in the embedded content will be hidden using CSS:
    - on the Published website
    - and in Reading mode in this vault

-->

We continually work to improve the Tasks plugin, but at any given time, due to the sheer volume of work, there will always be outstanding requests and known issues.

This page gathers together all the documentation on known limitations of the plugin, in the hope that it will save users from spending time crafting reports for known issues.
