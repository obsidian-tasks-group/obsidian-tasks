## Task management for the Obsidian knowledge base

Track tasks across your entire [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/) vault.
Query them and mark them as done wherever you want.
Supports due dates, recurring tasks (repetition), done dates, sub-set of checklist items, and filtering.

You can toggle the task status in any view or query and it will update the source file.
