## Limitations of Tasks Emoji Format

### Non-breaking spaces: NBSP characters

When copying and pasting text from websites, spaces are sometimes pasted in as `NBSP` characters.

These are generally visible in text editors, but in Obsidian they look like ordinary spaces.

Tasks does not currently treat these characters as spaces, and so emojis and their values may not be read correctly.

We are tracking this in [issue #606](https://github.com/obsidian-tasks-group/obsidian-tasks/issues/606).

### Manual 'double up' arrow emoji not recognised

See [[Tasks Emoji Format#Unicode Variation Selectors]] below.

### Unicode Variation Selectors

Tasks does not understand unicode [Variation Selectors](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Variation_Selectors_(Unicode_block)).

There has been a report of this preventing Tasks from reading the High Priority emoji (⏫) correctly, when added manually.

We are tracking this in [issue #2273](https://github.com/obsidian-tasks-group/obsidian-tasks/issues/2273).
