## Motivation

I would like to create a list of tasks that will be due in the coming 7 days.

How can I write this without using a hard-coded (fixed) date?

## tl;dr

Use `due before in 7 days`.

## The hard-coded way

This page was written on 8th September 2022, that is 2022-09-08, and the following search gave the desired results, using a fixed date:

    ```tasks
    not done
    due before 2022-09-15
    ```

## Setting up data to test the rules

Just as when writing software, when writing a new search rule it's worth generating good test data to satisfy yourself you really are getting the tasks you want.

In this case, as of `2022-09-08`, we want tasks up to and including `2022-09-15`, but no further. So here is a good continuous range of due dates, for testing our new search on that date:

```text
Example tasks, to test the filter:

- [ ] 0 days ğŸ“… 2022-09-08
- [ ] 1 days ğŸ“… 2022-09-09
- [ ] 2 days ğŸ“… 2022-09-10
- [ ] 3 days ğŸ“… 2022-09-11
- [ ] 4 days ğŸ“… 2022-09-12
- [ ] 5 days ğŸ“… 2022-09-13
- [ ] 6 days ğŸ“… 2022-09-14
- [ ] 7 days ğŸ“… 2022-09-15
- [ ] 8 days ğŸ“… 2022-09-16
- [ ] 9 days ğŸ“… 2022-09-17
```

With the above search, these tasks give this result:

```text
0 days ğŸ“… 2022-09-08
1 days ğŸ“… 2022-09-09
2 days ğŸ“… 2022-09-10
3 days ğŸ“… 2022-09-11
4 days ğŸ“… 2022-09-12
5 days ğŸ“… 2022-09-13
6 days ğŸ“… 2022-09-14
7 tasks
```

## The general way

The way to select dates before a specific future date is `before in ...`. So for our current search, we would use `due before in 7 days`:

    ```tasks
    not done
    due before in 7 days
    ```

With the above date, that search gives the desired result:

```text
0 days ğŸ“… 2022-09-08
1 days ğŸ“… 2022-09-09
2 days ğŸ“… 2022-09-10
3 days ğŸ“… 2022-09-11
4 days ğŸ“… 2022-09-12
5 days ğŸ“… 2022-09-13
6 days ğŸ“… 2022-09-14
7 tasks
```

- Some examples are written in the [Dates section of the Filters docs]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link queries/filters.md %}#dates).
- And perhaps more useful are the date-based examples in the [Queries Examples page]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link queries/examples.md %}).
