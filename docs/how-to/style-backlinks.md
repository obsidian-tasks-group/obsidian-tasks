## Motivation and assumptions

In Tasks results, by default each task is displayed with its filename,
and the name of the previous heading, for example `(ACME > Steps to world domination)`.
This is called a **backlink**.

If you don't like how backlinks look, this guide shows how you can modify their appearance.

We assume that you know how to [use CSS snippets in Obsidian](https://help.obsidian.md/How+to/Add+custom+styles#Use+Themes+and+or+CSS+snippets).

## Default backlink style

Here is an example task block that does not hide any components of the output: sometimes you want to see all the information in each task.

    ```tasks
    not done
    description includes trash
    ```

This screenshot shows what this might look like, with some sample data:

![Tasks with vanilla backlink styles](https://github.com/obsidian-tasks-group/obsidian-tasks/raw/gh-pages/resources/screenshots/backlinks-default-style.png)

Notice that the backlinks (the blue file and heading names) can quite dominate the results, visually.

## Built-in options

We could use `hide backlink`, but then we would lose the ability to navigate to the source file.

We could also use `short mode`, which would replace the backlink text with an icon, but this would hide all the other properties of the task, such as due date and recurrence.

## Using CSS to de-emphasize the backlinks

We can de-emphasize the text in the backlinks, with [this CSS snippet](https://github.com/obsidian-tasks-group/obsidian-tasks/blob/gh-pages/resources/sample_vaults/Tasks-Demo/.obsidian/snippets/tasks-plugin-backlinks-small-grey.css):

```css
/* By David Phillips (autonia) https://github.com/autonia
   From https://github.com/obsidian-tasks-group/obsidian-tasks/discussions/622#discussioncomment-2649299
*/
.tasks-backlink {
    font-size: 0.7em;
    opacity: 0.6;
    filter: grayscale(60%);
}
```

Which gives us this result:

## Using CSS to replace the backlinks with icons

Or we can replace the backlink text with an icon, with [this CSS snippet](https://github.com/obsidian-tasks-group/obsidian-tasks/blob/gh-pages/resources/sample_vaults/Tasks-Demo/.obsidian/snippets/tasks-plugin-backlinks-icon.css):

```css
/* By Anna Kornfeld Simpson (@AnnaKornfeldSimpson) https://github.com/AnnaKornfeldSimpson
   From https://github.com/obsidian-tasks-group/obsidian-tasks/discussions/834#discussioncomment-3028600

   Then converted to embed the icon inside this .css file, to remove the need
   for an internet connection, as follows:
   1. Link icon downloaded from https://twemoji.twitter.com
      https://github.com/twitter/twemoji/blob/master/assets/svg/1f517.svg
      licensed under the CC-BY 4.0
   2. SVG encoded for embedding here with https://yoksel.github.io/url-encoder/
