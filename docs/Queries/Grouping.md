## Basics

> [!released]
Introduced in Tasks 1.6.0.

By default, Tasks displays tasks in a single list.

To divide the matching tasks up with headings, you can add `group by` lines to the query.

---

## Group by Task Statuses

For more information, including adding your own customised statuses, see [[Statuses]].

### Status

- `group by status` (Done or Todo, which is capitalized for visibility in the headings)
  - Note that the Done group is displayed before the Todo group,
      which differs from the Sorting ordering of this property.

### Status Name

- `group by status.name`
  - This groups by the names you give to your custom statuses, in alphabetical order.

> [!released]
`group by status.name` was introduced in Tasks 1.23.0.

### Status Type

- `group by status.type`
  - This groups by the types you have given to your custom statuses.
  - In order to impose a useful sort order, the types are prefixed with a number, so the groups will appear in this order, and with these group names:
    - `1 IN_PROGRESS`
    - `2 TODO`
    - `3 DONE`
    - `4 CANCELLED`
    - `5 NON_TASK`

> [!released]
`group by status.type` was introduced in Tasks 1.23.0.

---

## Group by Dates in Tasks

### Done Date

- `group by done`
  - The done date of the task, including the week-day, or `No done date`.

> [!released]
>
> - `done` grouping option was introduced in Tasks 1.7.0.

### Due Date

- `group by due`
  - The due date of the task, including the week-day, or `No due date`.

> [!released]
>
> - `due` grouping option was introduced in Tasks 1.7.0.

### Scheduled Date

- `group by scheduled`
  - The scheduled date of the task, including the week-day, or `No scheduled date`.

> [!released]
>
> - `scheduled` grouping option was introduced in Tasks 1.7.0.

### Start Date

- `group by start`
  - The start date of the task, including the week-day, or `No start date`.

> [!released]
>
> - `start` grouping option was introduced in Tasks 1.7.0.

### Created Date

- `group by created`
  - The created date of the task, including the week-day, or `No created date`.

> [!released]
`created` grouping option was introduced in Tasks 2.0.0.

### Happens

- `group by happens`
  - The earliest of start date, scheduled date, and due date, including the week-day, or `No happens date` if none of those are set.

> [!released]
`happens` grouping option was introduced in Tasks 1.11.0.

---

## Group by Other Task Properties

### Priority

- `group by priority`
  - The priority of the task, namely one of:
    - `Priority 0: Highest`
    - `Priority 1: High`
    - `Priority 2: Medium`
    - `Priority 3: None`
    - `Priority 4: Low`
    - `Priority 5: Lowest`

> [!released]
>
> - `priority` grouping option was introduced in Tasks 1.11.0.

### Urgency

- `group by urgency` ([[Urgency|urgency]])
  - Currently, the groups run from the lowest urgency to highest.
  - You can reverse this with `group by urgency reverse`.
  - In a future release, the default group order will become from the highest urgency to lowest.

> [!released]
>
> - `urgency` grouping option was introduced in Tasks 3.6.0.

### Recurrence

- `group by recurring`
  - Whether the task is recurring: either `Recurring` or `Not Recurring`.
- `group by recurrence`
  - The recurrence rule of the task, for example `every week on Sunday`, or `None` for non-recurring tasks.
  - Note that the text displayed is generated programmatically and standardised, and so may not exactly match the text in any manually typed tasks. For example, a task with `🔁 every Sunday` is grouped in `every week on Sunday`.

> [!released]
>
> - `recurring` and `recurrence` grouping options were introduced in Tasks 1.11.0.

### Tags

- `group by tags`
  - The tags of the tasks or `(No tags)`. If the task has multiple tags, it will show up under every tag.

> [!released]
>
> - `tags` grouping option was introduced in Tasks 1.10.0.

---

## Group by File Properties

### File Path

- `group by path` (the path to the file that contains the task, that is, the folder and the filename)

### Root

- `group by root` (the top-level folder of the file that contains the task, that is, the first directory in the path, which will be `/` for files in root of the vault)

> [!released]
`root` grouping option was introduced in Tasks 1.11.0.

### Folder

- `group by folder` (the folder to the file that contains the task, which will be `/` for files in root of the vault)

### File Name

- `group by filename` (the link to the file that contains the task, without the `.md` extension)
  - Note that tasks from different notes with the same file name will be grouped together in the same group.

### Backlink

- `group by backlink` (the text that would be shown in the task's [[Backlinks|backlink]], combining the task's file name and heading, but with no link added)

### Heading

- `group by heading` (the heading preceding the task, or `(No heading)` if there are no headings in the file)

---

## Group by Function

> [!released]
> Function instructions were introduced in Tasks X.Y.Z.

When you want to express a search for your Tasks, and the existing [[Filters]] do not satisdy your requirements, you can use function instructions for more control.

Tasks code blocks allow certain instructions to be written as JavaScript expressions, to give great customisability.

This page shows the available function instructions, and the reference page [[Task Properties]] shows the data types available to you, for use in your function instructions.

### grouping examples

```text
group by function task.priority
group by function task.status.nextStatusSymbol.replace(" ", "space")
group by function task.status.symbol.replace(" ", "space")
```

<!--
Using task.path, so not yet reading for public visibility:
```text
group by function task.path.replace("some/prefix/", "")
group by function reverse task.path.startsWith("journal/") ? "journal/" : task.path
group by function task.path.startsWith("journal/") ? "journal/" : task.path
```
-->

### Available Properties

The Reference section has a complete list of available [[Task Properties]].

### Troubleshooting

> [!Warning]
> Currently most types of error in function expressions are only evaluated when the search runs.
>
> This means that error messages are displayed in the group headings, when results are viewed.

#### Syntax error

The following example gives an error:

````text
```tasks
group by function hello
```
````

gives this heading name:

```text
##### Error: Failed calculating expression "hello". The error message was: hello is not defined
```

#### Group names must be strings

Expressions for `group by function` must currently return a single `string` value.

The following example returns a `boolean`:

````text
```tasks
group by function task.status.symbol === '/'
```
````

gives this heading name:

```text
##### Error: Incorrect type from expression "task.status.symbol === '/'" returned value "false" of type "boolean" which is not a "string"
```

---

## Multiple groups

You can add multiple `group by` query options, each on an extra line.
This will create nested groups.
The first group has the highest priority.

Each subsequent `group by` will generate a new heading-level within the existing grouping:

- First `group by` is displayed as `h4` headings
- Second `group by` is displayed as `h5` headings
- Third and subsequent `group by` are displayed as `h6` headings

See the [screenshots below](#screenshots) for how this looks in practice.

> [!info]
> Headings are displayed in case-sensitive alphabetical order, not the original order.

---

## Refining groups

### Reversing groups

> [!released]
> Reversing of group headings was introduced in Tasks 3.7.0.

After the name of the property that you want to group by, you can add the `reverse` keyword.
If given, the group headings will be reversed for that property.

For example:

- `group by due` will sort the group headings:
  - from **oldest** due date first...
  - to **newest** due date last
- `group by due reverse` will sort the group headings:
  - from **newest** due date first...
  - to **oldest** due date last

> [!tip]
> The `reverse` keyword controls the order that group headings are displayed.
>
> The [[Sorting|sort by]] facility, by contrast, controls the order in which displays are displayed *inside* each group.

### Limiting group size

You can limit the number of tasks in each group, perhaps to work on the most important things first.

See [[Limiting#Limit number of tasks in each group|Limit number of tasks in each group]].

---

## Notes

> [!info]
> The order of operations ensures that grouping does not modify which tasks are displayed, for example when the `limit` option is used:
>
> 1. all the filter instructions are run
> 1. then any sorting instructions are run
> 1. then any `limit` instructions are run
> 1. then finally any grouping instructions are run

---

## Screenshots

### Before

Here is an example Tasks result, without any `group by` commands:

![Tasks Ungrouped](../images/tasks_ungrouped.png)
Tasks not grouped.

### After

And here is what this might look like, when grouped by folder, filename and heading:

![Tasks Grouped](../images/tasks_grouped.png)
Tasks grouped.

---

## Examples

Give me three levels of grouping, to indicate the locations of my tasks:

    ```tasks
    not done
    group by folder
    group by filename
    group by heading
    ```

Show me tasks I need to do today - and put today's tasks first, for visibility:

    ```tasks
    not done
    due before tomorrow
    group by due reverse
    ```
