## The Simplest Query

You can list tasks from your entire vault by querying them using a `tasks` code block. You can edit the tasks from the query results by clicking on the little pencil icon next to them.
Tasks are by default sorted by status, due date, and then path. You can change the sorting (see query options below).

The simplest way to query tasks is this:

    ```tasks
    ```

In Live Preview and Reading modes, this will list *all* tasks from your vault, regardless of their properties like status.

This is probably not what you want.
Therefore, Tasks allows you to set query options to filter the tasks that you want to show.

For instance, you can show only the tasks (from anywhere in the vault) that are due today:

    ## Due today
    ```tasks
    due today
    not done
    ```

You can create as many task queries as you like, and you can also wrap them into [callouts](https://help.obsidian.md/Editing+and+formatting/Callouts) if you want to style them differently:

    > [!check] Due today
    > ```tasks
    > due today
    > not done
    > ```

In the following sections we will explain all the various options that are available for querying tasks.

## Limitations of Queries

> [!warning]
> The result list will list tasks unindented.
See [#60](https://github.com/obsidian-tasks-group/obsidian-tasks/discussions/60) for a discussion around the topic.

> [!warning]
> The result list will not contain any footnotes of the original task.
The footnotes will *not* be carried over to documents with ```tasks blocks.
