# About Queries

## The Simplest Query

You can list tasks from your entire vault by querying them using a `tasks` code block. You can edit the tasks from the query results by clicking on the little pencil icon next to them.
Tasks are by default sorted by status, due date, and then path. You can change the sorting (see query options below).

The simplest way to query tasks is this:

    ```tasks
    ```

In Live Preview and Reading modes, this will list *all* tasks from your vault, regardless of their properties like status.

This is probably not what you want.
Therefore, Tasks allows you to set query options to filter the tasks that you want to show.
*All the queries are case insensitive.*

See [#60](https://github.com/obsidian-tasks-group/obsidian-tasks/discussions/60) for a discussion around the topic.

The footnotes will *not* be carried over to documents with ```tasks blocks.
