# Global Query

## Summary

> [!released]
The Global Query setting was added in Tasks X.Y.Z.

Global Query is a powerful and flexible alternative to the [[Global Filter]].

You can set a global query in the settings that Tasks will add to the start of all the Queries in your vault.

> [!example]
> With a global query set to `path includes /tasks`, the following task block:
>
>     ```tasks
>     tags include work
>     ```
>
> will run as if it were:
>
>     ```tasks
>     path includes /tasks
>     tags include work
>     ```

## Examples

Currently, any query that is allowed in a task block will also work as your Global Query. This feature is especially useful for applying [filters](Filters) or [layout options](Layout) by default for all your queries.

> [!warning]
> It isn't always possible to override a filter or layout option set in the Global Query. We're tracking this across several issues: [issue #1619](https://github.com/obsidian-tasks-group/obsidian-tasks/issues/1619) and [issue #1806](https://github.com/obsidian-tasks-group/obsidian-tasks/issues/1806).

### [[Layout]]

> [!example]
> **Turn on short mode**
>
>     ```tasks
>     short mode
>     ```

> [!example]
> **Hide priority**
>
>     ```tasks
>     hide priority
>     ```
>
> > [!info]
> > You can override this in a task block using `show priority`

> [!example]
> **Show up to 50 tasks**
>
>
>     ```tasks
>     limit 50
>     ```
>
> > [!info]
> > You can override this in a task block by specifying a new limit in that task block

### [[Filters]]

> [!example]
> **Only show tasks under specific headings**
>
>     ```tasks
>     heading includes Task
>     ```

> [!example]
> **Exclude tasks from a specific path**
>
>     ```tasks
>     path regex does not match /^_templates/
>     ```

## Settings

The following setting in the [[Settings|Tasks Options pane]] controls the vault's global query:

Changing the global query should take effect without restarting Obsidian, but open queries may need to be refreshed.
