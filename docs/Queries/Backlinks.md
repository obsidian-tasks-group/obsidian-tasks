# Backlinks

<span class="related-pages">#feature/backlinks</span>

## What are backlinks?

In Tasks search results, by default each task is displayed with its filename,
and the name of the previous heading, for example `(ACME > Steps to world domination)`.
This is called a **backlink**.

This screenshot shows what this might look like, with some sample data:

![Tasks with vanilla backlink styles](../images/backlinks-default-style.png)

If the filename and previous heading are identical, or if there is no previous heading, only the filename is shown.

## Using backlinks for navigation

You can click on a backlink to navigate directly to the task's source line.

> [!Tip]
> This honours the standard Obsidian keyboard modifiers used when clicking on internal links, to control how the note is opened (Navigate, New Tab, New Tab Group, New Window).
>
> See the table in the Tabs section of the [Obsidian 1.0.0 release notes](https://obsidian.md/changelog/2022-10-13-desktop-v1.0.0/).

> [!released]
> Navigating directly to the task line was introduced in Tasks 3.4.0.
