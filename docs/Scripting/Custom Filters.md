# Custom Filters

<span class="related-pages">#feature/scripting #feature/filters</span>

> [!released]
> Custom filters were introduced in Tasks 4.2.0.

## Summary

- Define your own custom task filters, using JavaScript expressions such as:
  - `filter by function task.description.replace('#task ', '').length < 3`
- The expression must evaluate to a `boolean`, so `true` or `false`.
- There are loads of examples in [[Filters]].
  - Search for `filter by function` in that file.
- Find all the supported tasks properties in [[Task Properties]] and [[Quick Reference]].
  - A number of properties are only available for custom filters and grouping, and not for built-in grouping instructions.
- Learn a bit about how expressions work in [[Expressions]].

## Custom filters introduction

The Tasks plugin provides a lot of built-in ways to [[Filters|filter]] tasks in Tasks query results.

But sometimes the built-in facility just doesn't quite do what you want.

**Custom filtering** allows you to **invent your own search scheme** to group tasks.

You use the instruction `filter by function` and then add a rule, written in JavaScript, to determine whether or not each task should be included in the search results. See the examples below.

## How it works

### Available Task Properties

The Reference section [[Task Properties]] shows all the task properties available for use in custom filters.

The available task properties are also shown in the [[Quick Reference]] table.

### Expressions

The instructions look like this:

- `filter by function <expression>`

The expression is evaluated (calculated) on one task at a time from our vault.

The expression must evaluate to a `boolean`, so `true` or `false`.

If the expression result is `true` for a task, it means that this task matches your custom filter.

And of course, if the expression result is `false`, this task does not match your custom filter.

## Example custom filters

Below are some examples to give a flavour of what can be done with custom filters.

You can find many more examples by searching for `filter by function` in the [[Filters]] page.

### Text property examples

<!-- placeholder to force blank line before included text --><!-- include: CustomFilteringExamples.test.other_properties_task.description_docs.approved.md -->

- ```filter by function task.description.length > 100```
  - Find tasks with long descriptions.

### Date property examples

<!-- placeholder to force blank line before included text --><!-- include: CustomFilteringExamples.test.dates_task.due_docs.approved.md -->

- ```filter by function task.due.format('dddd') === 'Tuesday'```
  - Find tasks due on Tuesdays, that is, any Tuesday.
  - On non-English systems, you may need to supply the day of the week in the local language.

For users who are comfortable with JavaScript, these more complicated examples may also be of interest:

<!-- placeholder to force blank line before included text --><!-- include: CustomFilteringExamples.test.dates_task.due.advanced_docs.approved.md -->

- ```filter by function task.due.moment?.isSameOrBefore(moment(), 'day') || false```
  - Find all tasks due today or earlier.
  - `moment()` returns the current date and time, which we need to convert to the start of the day.
  - As the second parameter determines the precision, and not just a single value to check, using 'day' will check for year, month and day.
  - See the documentation of [isSameOrBefore](https://momentjscom.readthedocs.io/en/latest/moment/05-query/04-is-same-or-before/).
- ```filter by function task.due.moment?.isSameOrAfter(moment(), 'day') || false```
  - Due today or later.
- ```filter by function task.due.moment?.isSame(moment('2023-05-31'), 'day') || false```
  - Find all tasks due on 31 May 2023.
- ```filter by function task.due.moment?.isSame(moment('2023-05-31'), 'week') || false```
  - Find all tasks due in the week of 31 May 2023.

### Number property examples

<!-- placeholder to force blank line before included text --><!-- include: CustomFilteringExamples.test.other_properties_task.urgency_docs.approved.md -->

- ```filter by function task.urgency > 8.9999```
  - Find tasks with an urgency score above `9.0`.
  - Note that limiting value used is `8.9999`.
  - Searches that compare two urgency values for 'less than' or 'more than' (using one of `>`, `>=`, `<` or `<=`) **must adjust their values slightly to allow for rounding**.
- ```filter by function task.urgency > 7.9999 && task.urgency < 11.0001```
  - Find tasks with an urgency score between `8.0` and `11.0`, inclusive.
- ```filter by function task.urgency.toFixed(2) === 1.95.toFixed(2)```
  - Find tasks with the [[Urgency#Why do all my tasks have urgency score 1.95?|default urgency]] of `1.95`.
  - This is the correct way to do an equality or inequality search for any numeric values.
  - The `.toFixed(2)` on both sides of the `===` ensures that two numbers being compared are both rounded to the same number of decimal places (2).
  - This is important, to prevent being tripped up `10.29` being not exactly the same when comparing non-integer numbers.
- ```filter by function task.urgency.toFixed(2) !== 1.95.toFixed(2)```
  - Find tasks with any urgency other than the default score of `1.95`.
- ```filter by function task.urgency === 10.29```
  - **This will not find any tasks**.
  - ==Do not use raw numbers in searches for equality or inequality of any numbers==, either seemingly integer or floating point ones.
  - From using `group by urgency` and reviewing the headings, we might conclude that tasks with the following values have urgency `10.19`:
    - due tomorrow,
    - have no priority symbol.
  - From this, it might be natural to presume that we can search for `task.urgency === 10.29`.
  - However, our function is checking the following values for equality:
    - `task.urgency` is approximately:
      - `10.292857142857140928526860079728`
    - `10.29` is approximately:
      - `10.289999999999999147348717087880`
  - These values are **not exactly equal**, so the test fails to find any matching tasks.

### File property examples

<!-- placeholder to force blank line before included text --><!-- include: CustomFilteringExamples.test.file_properties_task.file.folder_docs.approved.md -->

- ```filter by function task.file.folder === "Work/Projects/"```
  - Find tasks in files in any file in the given folder **only**, and not any sub-folders.
  - The equality test, `===`, requires that the trailing slash (`/`) be included.
- ```filter by function task.file.folder.includes("Work/Projects/")```
  - Find tasks in files in any folder **and any sub-folders**.
- ```filter by function task.file.folder.includes("Work/Projects")```
  - By leaving off the trailing slash (`/`) this would also find tasks in any file inside folders such as:
    - `Work/Projects 2023/`
    - `Work/Projects Top Secret/`
