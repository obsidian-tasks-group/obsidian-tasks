# Query Properties

<span class="related-pages">#feature/scripting</span>

> [!released]
>
> - Query Properties were introduced in Tasks 4.7.0.
> - Their direct use in Custom Groups, without the use of Placeholders, was introduced in Tasks X.Y.Z.

## Introduction

In a growing number of locations, Tasks allows programmatic/scripting access to properties of the file containing the search query:

- [[Placeholders]]
- [[Custom Grouping]]

This page documents all the available pieces of information in Queries that you can access.

> [!warning]
>
> - Placeholders can be in [[Custom Filters]], but must be surrounded by quotes. For example: `'{{query.file.folder}}'`.
> - In a future release, we will allow expressions such as `query.file.folder` to be used directly in custom filters.
