# Expressions

<span class="related-pages">#feature/scripting</span>

> [!released]
> Expressions were introduced in Tasks 4.0.0.

## Introduction

> [!Note]
> Writing a full explanation of the JavaScript language is outside the scope of this documentation.
>
> We provide some introductory material and some well-thought-out examples to give you ideas, and encourage you to experiment and try the feature out for yourself.

## What are Expressions?

- Language is JavaScript.
- The expression is a string instruction.
- It must fit on one line.
  - As of Tasks 4.4.0, variables, functions, `if` blocks and similar can be used. See [[#More complex expressions]].
- Depending on the context, one or two tasks are passed in to the expression, and a calculation is performed.
  - As of Tasks 4.0.0, in fact only a single task is passed in, to implement [[Custom Grouping]].
  - As of Tasks 4.2.0, a single task is passed in, to implement [[Custom Filters]].
- Tasks then calculates a value from the inputs.

## Example expressions

The real value of expressions is to calculate values from data in tasks.

In this section, we use artificially simple fixed expressions, to demonstrate the kinds of abilities available.

Each line below is of the form:

~~~text
expression => result
~~~

### Simple expressions

Some example expressions:

<!-- placeholder to force blank line before included text --><!-- include: Expression.test.Expression_result.approved.md -->

~~~text
'hello' => 'hello'
"hello" => 'hello'
"" => ''
[] => []
"" || "No value" => 'No value'
false => false
true => true
1 => 1
0 => 0
0 || "No value" => 'No value'
1.0765456 => 1.0765456
6 * 7 => 42
["heading1", "heading2"] => ['heading1', 'heading2']
[1, 2] => [1, 2]
null => null
null || "No value" => 'No value'
undefined => undefined
undefined || "No value" => 'No value'
"I _am_ not _italic_".replaceAll("_", "\\_") => 'I \_am\_ not \_italic\_'
~~~

<!-- placeholder to force blank line after included text --><!-- endInclude -->

Note:

- Single quotes (`'`) and double quotes (`"`) are generally equivalent and you can use whichever you prefer.
- The `||` means 'or'. If the expression to the left of the `||` fails, the expression on the right is used instead.
- You can experiment with these values by adding them to a `group by function` line in a Tasks query block.
- If you don't write a `return` statement, Tasks adds one for you.

### More complex expressions

As of Tasks 4.4.0, it is also possible to use more complex constructs in expressions:

- `return` statements
- named variables
- `if` statements
- functions

<!-- placeholder to force blank line before included text --><!-- include: Expression.test.Expression_returns_and_functions.approved.md -->

~~~text
return 42 => 42
const x = 1 + 1; return x * x => 4
if (1 === 1) { return "yes"; } else { return "no" } => 'yes'
function f(value) { if (value === 1 ) { return "yes"; } else { return "no"; } } return f(1) => 'yes'
