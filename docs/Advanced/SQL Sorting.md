# Sorting

<span class="related-pages">#advanced/sql-search</span>

There is no default sorting for the SQL based queries, if you want to have a order you need to specify it.

## Using Â `ORDER BY`

Syntax:

    ORDER BY expression1 [ASC|DESC], ...

You can specify order with keywords:

- `ASC` - ascending (by default)
- `DESC` - descending

The expression can be any of the columns available to you.

This example returns all the completed tasks ordering by due date and then done date.

````text
```task-sql
WHERE status->symbol = 'x'
ORDER BY dueDate DESC, doneDate DESC
```
````
