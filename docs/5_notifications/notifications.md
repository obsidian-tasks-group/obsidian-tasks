# Notifications

Within Tasks, notifications can be made possible by utilizing [obsidian-reminder](https://github.com/uphy/obsidian-reminder).
This utilizes the standard Tasks date (as the due date) and can be extended with an additional reminder date by including a ⏰ and a date/time in the format `⏰ YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM`.
Further, a default reminder can be enabled based on the Tasks' 'Due Date'.
To enable this make sure obsidian-reminder has enabled the tasks plugin format as below:
