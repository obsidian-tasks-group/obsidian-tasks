# Contribution Guidelines Obsidian Tasks

Thank you for wanting to contribute to Obsidian Tasks!
Every contribution is much appreciated!

## Updating documentation

The documentation resides under the `./docs` directory.
It consists of markdown files, which [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) will transform into web pages that you can view at <https://obsidian-tasks-group.github.io/obsidian-tasks/> .
In the simplest case, you can update the existing markdown file and create a pull request (PR) with your changes.

### Version numbers in documentation

We have introduced version markers to the documentation, to show users in which version a specific feature was introduced.
This means that newly written documentation should be tagged with a placeholder, which will be replaced with the actual
version upon release.

There are 2 styles of placeholders used through the documentation, Please pick the one that
fits your text better. (If in doubt, take a look at the existing version tags for other features.)

- `> Introduced in Tasks X.Y.Z`
  - This placeholder is usually used after a section heading.
- `> X (Y and Z) was introduced in Tasks X.Y.Z`
  - This placeholder is used when you need to tag a sub-part of something, for example a list.

### How the documentation is generated

We use [GitHub pages](https://pages.github.com/) for our documentation.
You can read more about it at their [official documentation](https://docs.github.com/en/pages).

To generate the documentation site on your machine,
see [docs/README.md](docs/README.md).

### Documentation and branches

For documentation changes to show up at <https://obsidian-tasks-group.github.io/obsidian-tasks/> , they must be in the `gh-pages` branch.
If you want to see your changes available immediately and not only after the next release, you should make your changes on the `gh-pages` branch.
When you create a PR, it should merge into the `gh-pages` branch as well.
If you document an unreleased feature, you should update the documentation on `main` instead. Ideally together with the related code changes.
If this is confusing, don't worry.
We will help you make this right once you opened the PR.

## Updating code

Ideally, an [issue](https://github.com/obsidian-tasks-group/obsidian-tasks/issues) already exists and we discussed your implementation in that issue before you open the pull request (PR).
This is _not_ mandatory, but it helps improve the process and reduce unnecessary back-and-forth.

Once you want to propose your changes, create a PR and we'll have a look when we have time.
Discussion will take place inside the PR.

If you can, please add/update tests and documentation where appropriate.

## Maintaining the tests

The tests use the [ts-jest](https://www.npmjs.com/package/ts-jest) wrapper around the
[jest](https://jestjs.io) test framework.

The [Expect](https://jestjs.io/docs/expect) page is a good reference for the many jest testing features.

### Writing Tests for New or Refactored Code

#### Think of it as testing user-visible features

- Tests that test low-level implementation details are hard to maintain over time. Instead, test user-visible features.
- Try to think of the purpose of the code that has missing tests.
  - For example, in `taskFromLine()` in `src/Commands/CreateOrEdit.ts` the comments are quite useful in terms of showing the different scenarios being considered. Something like:
        _already a task line with a global filter, already a task line missing the global filter, already a task line and there is no global filter, already a bullet item, not in a bullet item_
  - These then would be good tests to write, i.e. test that each of those scenarios does actually behave as expected.
  - And if the implementation changed in future, those tests would be extremely useful to the maintainer at the time.
  - And if a new behaviour was added in future, it would be obvious how to add a new test for it.

#### Location of code

Often, untested code is in locations that you can't call in tests (e.g. because it uses some Obsidian code).
All that needs to be done then is to refactor - via 'move method' or 'extract method') the code out to a different source file.
For more about refactoring safely and easily, see the talk [Refactoring Superpowers: Make Your IDE Do Your Work, Faster and More Safely](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BX6gh2xNiuU).

#### Then start writing tests

If you struggle to name a Jest `it` test, think in terms of _should_: e.g. _should convert a line with no bullet to ..._

### Snapshot Tests

For testing more complex objects, some of the tests here use Jest's
[Snapshot Testing](https://jestjs.io/docs/snapshot-testing) facility, which is similar to
[Approval Tests](https://approvaltests.com) but easier to use in JavaScript.

For readability of snapshots, we favour [Inline Snapshots](https://jestjs.io/docs/snapshot-testing#inline-snapshots),
which are saved in the source code. See that documentation for how to easily update the inline
snapshot, if the output is intended to be changed.

### Jest and the WebStorm IDE

The WebStorm IDE has a [helpful page](https://www.jetbrains.com/help/webstorm/running-unit-tests-on-jest.html)
on how it makes testing with jest easy.

Note in particular the
[Snapshot testing section](https://www.jetbrains.com/help/webstorm/running-unit-tests-on-jest.html#ws_jest_snapshot_testing)
for how to view the diffs in the event of snapshot test failures, and also how to update the saved snapshot
of one or all snapshot failures.

## Setting up build environment

This project uses Node 14.x, if you need to use a different version, look at using `nvm` to manage your Node versions. If you are using `nvm`, you can install the 14.x version of Node with `nvm install 14.19.1; nvm use 14.19.1`.

To setup the local environment after cloning the repository, run the following commands:

```shell
yarn
yarn build
yarn test
yarn lint
```

Make sure you build, test and lint before pushing to the repository. Left hook is used to cover these checks before commit and push. To run just the markdown lint you can use `yarn run lint:markdown`.

## Local development

When developing locally, you can use the `yarn dev` command to start a development build. This will cause a rebuild of the code base every time you make a change so you can see if there are any code errors.

If you want to build and test in a local obsidian vault use `yarn run build:dev` this will generate the `main.js` in the root of the repository which has the sourcemap in it to make debugging using the development console (`Ctrl+Shift+i`) in Obsidian easier.

To make it simpler to work on the files you can use `deploy:local` which will create a symbolic link to the plugins folder for this plugin (`obsidian-tasks-plugin`). When ever a build occurs using `yarn run dev` or `yarn run build:dev` the plugin will be updated in the obsidian vault you are targeting using the `OBSIDIAN_PLUGIN_ROOT` environment variable.

It is recommended you use the [Hot-Reload](https://github.com/pjeby/hot-reload) plugin to automatically reload the plugin when files change. The script will create a `.hotreload` file in the root of the repository to assist.

## FAQs

### How does Tasks handle status changes?

You can toggle a task‘s status by:

1. using the command (may be bound to a hotkey),
2. clicking on a checkbox of an inline task in Reading mode,
3. clicking on a checkbox of an inline task in Live Preview, or
4. clicking on a checkbox in query results (same for Reading mode and Live Preview).

The code is located as follows:

- For 1.: `./src/Commands/ToggleDone.ts`
- Numbers 2. and 4. use a checkbox created by `Task.toLi()`. There, the checkbox gets a click event handler.
- For 3.: `./src/LivePreviewExtension.ts`

Toggle behavior:

- Number 1. toggles the line directly where the cursor is in the file inside Obsidian's vault.
- The click event listener of 2. and 4. uses `File::replaceTaskWithTasks()`. That, in turn, updates the file in Obsidian‘s Vault (like 1, but it needs to find the correct line).
- Number 3. toggles the line directly where the checkbox is on the "document" of CodeMirror (the library that Obsidian uses to show text on screen). That, in turn, updates the file in Obsidian's Vault.

Obsidian writes the changes to disk at its own pace.

### How do I test a GitHub build of the Tasks plugin?

1. Go to the [Verify Commit actions page](https://github.com/obsidian-tasks-group/obsidian-tasks/actions/workflows/verify.yml).
2. Click on the build of the code version you want to test. For example, you might click on the build for a particular pull request, or the most recent build on `main`.
3. In the Artifacts section at the bottom, click on **dist-verified** to download a build of the plugin.
4. Expand the downloaded `dist-verified.zip` file
5. Copy the files in the expanded folder to the `.obsidian/plugins/obsidian-tasks-plugin/` folder in your vault, over-writing the previous files.
6. Restart Obsidian.

### How do I smoke-test the Tasks plugin?

Follow the steps in `resources/sample_vaults/Tasks-Demo/Manual Testing/Smoke Testing the Tasks Plugin.md`.

### How do I make a release?

1. Check out the `main` branch
2. Check for the current version in `package.json` (e.g. `1.4.1`) and decide on a next version
    - Backwards incompatible change: increase major version
    - New functionality: increase minor version
    - Only bug fixes: increase patch version
3. Having decided on the new version, replace all `X.Y.Z` in the documentation with the new version number.
4. Check the current version of the obsidian dependency in `package.json` (e.g. `0.13.21`)
5. Run `./release.sh <new tasks version> <obsidian version>`
    - Make sure there are no uncommitted changes. Stash them if necessary.
6. Wait for [GitHub Actions](https://github.com/obsidian-tasks-group/obsidian-tasks/actions/workflows/release.yml) to create the new release
7. Update the release description with the changes of the release
    - On the release page, GitHub provides a button to auto-generate release notes which works nicely.
    - Also update the attached zip file by adding the version number to the end of the name after the dash (e.g. `obsidian-tasks-1.4.1.zip`)
8. Optional: Post to
    - Obsidian Discord
    - r/ObsidianMD on Reddit
    - etc.
